  <h1>SHOULD WE RECOGNISE <strong>BIT COIN</strong> AS LEGAL CURRENCY IN INDIA</h1>
  <p>The RBI holds 600+ tons of gold, during economic crisis the rupee may need to be gold backed. If we issue digital rupee we will need digital gold to back it up with. Bit Coin is valuable for all the same reasons gold is valuable i.e both Bit
    Coin and Gold are finite. If we are going to have a digital rupee, digital gold will play an important part of our monetary policy.

    We call it crypto currency because all the transactions on the network are protected through cryptography. In crypto it is not easy to do fraud , scam and corruption. A Bit Coin ban will ensure that many technological developments will not happen
    in India. It is like cutting India off from financial internet or banning a smart phone in 2010.

    The first step is simple : <em><strong>India should buy Bit Coin ,not ban it.</strong></em></p>
