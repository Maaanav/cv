  <p>Today I have started with web develpment on udemy.My self <strong>Manav Mangela</strong>, I am an artificial intelligence and data science F.E student, and today I will give a speech on “Should we recognise BIT COIN as a legal currency“ .
    Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money which can be stored on your computer or phone and it can be sent peer to peer with no bank and intermediately.
    Bit Coin works on block chain technology.
    If you hold a Bit Coin you have a public key and a private key. A public key is like your email address which you can give anyone who can sent you bit coin. But private key is like your email password which protect your Bit Coin. If you forget
    your private key it means you have lost your Bit Coin.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Advantages of having a Bit Coin are:-</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>

    <li>Decentralised:- which means no central authority can control it.</li<br>
    <li>No Transaction Restrictions:- which simply mean it is available to everyone of every nationality.</li<br>
    <li><strong>Secure</strong>:- It provides unalterable records of every transaction made on a network, mean nobody can make changes on it.</li<br>
    <li><strong>Privacy</strong>:- This transaction are anonymous.</li<br>
    <li><strong>Limited</strong>:- there is a finite amount of cryptocurrency, which means nobody can print it, that’s why people also call crypto as <strong><em>“Digital Gold”</em></strong.< /li>

  </ul>
